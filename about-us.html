  <h1> Meet the Nanonauts </h1>
  <p> We are the Nanonauts </p>

    <h2>Daniel - Singer extraordinaire </h2>
    <p><img class="small" src="images/daniel.jpg" alt="Picture of Daniel"/></p>
    <p>Daniel is the Nanonauts singer. He likes to sing all the time – not just when he's playing with the Nanonauts! His mum and dad say he learned to sing before he learned to talk!</p>

    <p>Daniel also plays clarinet and is learning the alto saxophone.</p>

    <h2> Sam – One-man rhythm section </h2>
    <p><img class="small" src="images/SAM.jpg" alt="Picture of Sam"/></p>
    <p>Sam had music in his blood from the day he was born. His dad says he was named after a famous folk musician (can you guess who?) but his mum says this is nonsense and he was named after a rabbit. On some songs he plays the bass guitar and on some songs the drums. Sam loves playing in the Nanonauts but hates carrying his drumkit around.</p>

    <h2> Holly – If it's got strings, she'll play it </h2>
    <p><img class="small" src="images/holly.jpg" alt="Picture of Holly"/></p>
    <p>Acoustic guitar? Electric lead guitar? Ukelele? Harp? Helen can play them all. She started off by making homemade guitars from cardboard boxes and elastic bands till her uncle took pity on her and bought her a Spanish guitar for Christmas. After a few lessons at school she was flying!</p>

    <h2> Dervla – Keyboard maestro </h2>
    <p><img class="small" src="images/darvla.png" alt="Picture of Darvla"/></p>
    <p>Dervla has Grade 4 piano but in secret prefers to play electronic keyboards. She loves synthesizer sounds and arguing with Holly over who should play the basslines.</p>
